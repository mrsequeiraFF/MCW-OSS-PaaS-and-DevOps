# OSS PaaS and DevOps
# trigger piopeline
Best For You Organics Company is one of the leading online health food suppliers in North America, serving customers in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. They launched their highly-successful e-commerce website, which sells subscriptions to their meal service, in 2016, and have been steadily increasing their subscriber-base since. Their service caters to working professionals looking for convenient, reliable access to healthy meal choices, and pre-packaged recipes without having to spend too much time preparing the meals.

Their CIO is a big proponent of open-source software, and their web application uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.JS, Node.js). They host their code in a private GitHub repository. They currently have a continuous integration workflow, triggered by each code check-in/commit in GitHub, using Jenkins.

As their service has grown, they have found that the management of VM and server infrastructure is a real challenge. They want to learn more about how Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions for OSS applications on Azure might be able to help. Their goal is to focus their expenditures and efforts on their core business, rather than infrastructure. The development team at Best For You Organics has indicated they have some experience with Docker. They are interested in what options might be available for using containers to deploy their application into a cloud environment. They are also interested in learning more about identity management.

The development team has also expressed that they would like to continue using GitHub as their code repository but is interested in improving upon their DevOps pipeline. They currently use Jenkins for their builds and are interested in any tools available in a cloud offering that could help with release management, or other aspects of a fully-integrated, modern DevOps pipeline. Ultimately, their goal is to automate and simplify deployments through CI/CD capabilities and deliver updates faster and more reliably.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you gain a better understanding of how to integrate and deploy complex open-source software (OSS) workloads into Azure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). You will migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure PaaS services, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

At the end of this workshop, you will learn how to provision Web App for Containers for hosting OSS applications, migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB, implement serverless technologies, such as Logic Apps and Azure Functions, to enhance OSS app functionality, provision an Azure Container Registry, build Docker images and push them into the Azure Container Registry, and enable continuous deployment with Jenkins.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you work with a group to design a solution for integrating and deploying complex open-source software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. Your solution should handle the migration of an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application. The application will be migrated from a hosted environment into Azure PaaS services, including migrating an existing MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB, enhancing application functionality using serverless technologies, and fully embracing modern DevOps tools.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design solutions for migrating OSS applications into Azure PaaS using modern DevOps methodologies.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you implement a solution for integrating and deploying complex open-source software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. You migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure Web App for Containers, migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB, enhance application functionality using serverless technologies, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to migrate and deploy OSS applications into Azure PaaS using modern DevOps methodologies and Docker containers.
